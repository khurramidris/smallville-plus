# Phase 1 progress

## Step 1 — Specification and environment
- Saved the complete user request in `SPEC.md` before implementation.
- Workspace was empty; Python 3.12 is available. Pydantic, FastAPI, Uvicorn and HTTPX are installed.
- Cloud environment reports unrestricted networking, no configured model variables or API credentials.
- No paid service has been added or called.

## Next
1. Inspect reference licenses and primary sources; record provenance.
2. Build the world, event engine, model gateway, agents, GM and two phone apps.
3. Add the CLI, evaluation harness and local replay viewer.
4. Run offline tests and a two-day, 25-agent acceptance simulation.

## Step 2 — Reference inspection and provenance
- Read all six current-phase repository licenses before copying any material.
- Retained original Smallville Tiled map, collision/sector matrices, relationship
  whispers and all 25 persona scratch seeds at pinned upstream commit hashes.
- Studied Concordia event resolution/scene tracking, ARE event/notification
  documentation, HumanoidAgents drives and genagents persona organization.
- Recorded source paths, hashes and licenses in `THIRD_PARTY.md` and `references/`.
- Verified paper §7.1 benchmark targets: Sam 8/25; party 13/25; attendance
  5/12 guests; mutual-knowledge density 0.167 to 0.74.
- Installed local test tools and the LiteLLM library. This adds no paid service.
- No network download was blocked.

## Step 3 — World and event engine
- Added typed world entities, SQLite WAL projections, hash-chained append-only
  events, a JSONL mirror with interrupted-write recovery, and replay.
- Added deterministic simulated clock, ordered heap scheduler, condition triggers
  and asynchronous event subscriptions.
- Added a swappable map contract and a tile-derived Smallville graph with
  addresses, hours, capacities and walkable travel routes.
- Validation: 5 engine/world tests pass with network sockets disabled; Ruff passes.
- Found and fixed an upstream-map integration issue: centroid tiles can fall in
  isolated rooms, and the largest walkable component is exterior decoration.
  Representatives now use the component connecting the most named sectors.

## Open issues / acceptance
- (a) Offline tests: pending.
- (b) Two MockLLM days / 25 agents: pending.
- (c) Valentine's benchmark: pending.
- (d) One paid API day under cap: pending explicit approval and configured models/credentials.
- Later phases are deliberately out of scope.

## Step 4 — Model gateway and offline backend
- Added env-only live model configuration, individual model overrides, a lazy
  LiteLLM adapter and a deterministic MockLLM fixture.
- Added persistent response caching by model, request/prompt hash and seed;
  sampling parameters are included in the hash.
- Added durable per-call model/token/USD accounting, preflight reservations,
  a hard stop before unaffordable requests, and conservative charging for failures.
- Paid requests require explicit opt-in, a positive cap and configured pricing.
- Validation: 10 tests pass offline, including concurrent budget checks, cache
  replay, retained failed-call reservations and sanitized provider errors.
